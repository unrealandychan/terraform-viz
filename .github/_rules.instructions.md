# Clean Code + DDD Review Rules

Scope: readability and maintainability only. High-confidence findings only. Max 3 per file by impact.
No finding → reply: "No significant Clean Code issues found."

## Clean Code

| Rule                    | Severity | Flag when                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `meaningful-names`      | medium   | Vague names: `data`, `tmp`, `res`, `doStuff`, `flag`                       |
| `single-responsibility` | high     | Function/class mixes validation, persistence, business logic, side effects |
| `minimize-duplication`  | high     | Business logic repeated across 2+ functions or files                       |
| `avoid-deep-nesting`    | medium   | Nested `if/else` hides happy path; guard clauses would flatten it          |
| `small-interfaces`      | medium   | 5+ mixed-purpose parameters                                                |
| `named-constants`       | low      | Unnamed business literals in logic                                         |
| `comment-why-not-what`  | low      | Comment restates code instead of explaining intent                         |
| `clear-error-handling`  | medium   | Silent failures, bare catch, generic exception, missing context            |

## DDD (apply when domain modelling exists)

| Rule                             | Severity | Flag when                                               |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ubiquitous-language`            | medium   | Generic name where a domain term exists                 |
| `bounded-context-violation`      | high     | Module imports another context's internals without ACL  |
| `aggregate-integrity-bypass`     | high     | External code mutates aggregate bypassing the root      |
| `value-object-mutability`        | medium   | Value-semantics object is mutable or identity-compared  |
| `domain-logic-in-adapters`       | high     | Business rules in controllers, handlers, or DB adapters |
| `missing-acl`                    | medium   | External model types referenced directly in domain code |
| `missing-repository-abstraction` | medium   | Domain code calls ORM/SQL/HTTP directly                 |
| `missing-domain-event`           | low      | State transition side effects via direct calls          |

## Output

```
## Clean Code Review
Files reviewed: N | Findings: N (High: N, Medium: N, Low: N)

### Finding N
- Severity: high | medium | low
- Rule: <rule-id>
- Location: <file>:<line>
- Problem: <what>
- Why it matters: <impact>
- Suggested fix: <action>
- Refactor example: (optional)
```

## Guardrails

- Skip formatting enforced by linters
- Every finding must cite a specific file and line
- No refactor demand when framework/business constraints apply
- No speculative findings — skip if unsure
- high/medium = mandatory · low = suggestion

## Simplicity First

- Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- The test: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

## Surgical Changes

- Touch only what you must. Don't improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.
- Remove imports, variables, or functions that **your** changes made unused, not pre-existing ones.
- The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## Think Before Coding

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
